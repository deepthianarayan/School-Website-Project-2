          Start Smart offers IB, IGSE, ISC, ICSE as well as the International
          Primary Years Program. The school envisions the students to become
          moral, empathetic, and socially responsible citizens of the century,
          who are rooted to their culture and are ready to accept any new
          challenges with a fresh approach towards learning. And to attain this,
          the school identifies multiple intelligences and offers theme-based
          learning, concept-based learning, exploration based, student centric
          learning, as well as differentiated learning for students of various
          abilities. Start Smart students not only balance academics, sports,
          and co-curricular activities, but excel in them. Greenwood High IB
          results far outshine the world average; the school has produced India
          toppers in both IGCSE and ICSE. And yet, these very same industrious
          students immerse themselves in theatre and with support from their
          theatre, art, and music teachers, and have presented ‘Annie’ a musical
          that was compared to professional theatre productions. To encourage
          them further, the school has held various workshops including one from
          the prestigious Globe Education.
