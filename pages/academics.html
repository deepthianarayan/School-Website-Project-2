          (SUPW). Group I subjects are compulsory and students must Select One
          Second Language from Group One, TWO from Group II and ONE from Group
          III. English is a compulsory subject. All students in Grades X and

          Criteria & Reporting Students are evaluated following the systematic
          format of Unit Test and Term Exams. Student learning is measured on an
          ongoing basis through regular cycle tests, term examinations and
          internal assessments. Grade IX and XI have two Unit Tests & two
          examination cycles. Grade X and XII have two Unit Tests & three
          Examination cycles. Academic reporting is in accordance with the
          standards outlined by the CISCE (in Percentages) The same grading
          system applies for the Predicted scores. The school does not rank
          students within subjects, class or cohort. The school also does not
          provide the GPA as a means of ranking student performance. Detailed
          reports for the same are shared with the parents.
